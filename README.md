A basic copy of the linux shell that can execute most of the well known commands contained using a Docker Image

To run the clone you can either clone it into your system if you have linux or follow the below commands:

1. Download docker for your system [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
2. Open your command prompt and type the following commands
3. docker login
4. docker pull abdulai00/mini_shell:d8sh_app
5. docker run -it abdulai00/mini_shell:d8sh_app


NOTE: The Lexer file and the parser file is not my work but a third party project I have permission to use.
